This next section of text lives in graf-2.txt (like all the files you'll edit here, it lives in the "text" folder). The idea of breaking things out into a number of different files was to let you see how numerous small pieces create a whole thingy. Once you've made and saved a few changes to the files in this branch, check out how Git follows the changes, and make a commit.
