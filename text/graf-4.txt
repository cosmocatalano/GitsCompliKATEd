If you like how your branch looks and you're ready to merge it, make a pull request. I'll check out your changes and after a few questions, I'll officially approve the merge. Then we'll be able to see it on the "live" site. It's a bit of simplifaction vs what tends to happen IRL, but it's a good Git intro. If you really want to do more stuff, try *adding* a new file called 'graf-5.txt', or deleting one of the other files in the "text" folder.
