Moving on to the graf-3.txt file, once you've made a few commits in your branch, publish it to remote. After that's done. you should be able to see it on the GitHub page for this repo (https://github.com/cosmocatalano/GitsCompliKATEd) but the "live" site (http://cosmocatalano.com/lab/gitscomplikated/) will remain unchanged because you haven't yet merged your branch into master.
