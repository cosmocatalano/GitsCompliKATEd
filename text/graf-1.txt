It Works! (at least in so far as any website that uses <object> really works). Anyway, this is the first file (graf-1.txt) that displays on this janky refernece page. When you edit graf-1.txt in your local repository, it will change the text that appears here. But before you change anything, make your own new branch to work inâ€”generally speaking you'll never edit the default branch (somewhat problematically called "master").
