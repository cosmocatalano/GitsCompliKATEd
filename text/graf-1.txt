It Works! (at least in so far as any website that uses <object> really works). Anyway, this is the first file (graf-1.txt) that displays on this janky reference page. It lives in the "text" folder of your your repository, and edits there will change the text that appears here. But before you change anything, make your own new branch to work inâ€”generally speaking you'll never edit the default branch (which is somewhat problematically called "master").
